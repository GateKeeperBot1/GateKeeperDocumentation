# GateKeeper Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 01/17/2026 (MM/DD/YY)

This Privacy Policy explains how data is collected, used, and stored by GateKeeper ("the Bot").

#### 1. Information We Collect

In order to function properly, the Bot may collect and store the following data from Discord:

- User IDs
- Guild (Server) IDs
- Channel IDs
- Messages sent in channels where the Bot is active
- Message metadata (such as timestamps)
- Reactions added to messages
- Command usage and configuration data

The Bot does not collect:
- Passwords
- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- Payment card details (all payments are handled by third-party processors)

#### 2. How We Use Data

All collected data is used solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Bot’s features, including but not limited to:

Responding to commands

Providing automated functionality

Maintaining server-specific settings

Improving reliability and performance

Data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising or tracking purposes.

#### 3. Data Storage and Retention

Data is stored only for as long as necessary for the Bot to function.

Some data may be cached or logged temporarily for performance or debugging.

Data may be deleted automatically when no longer required or upon removal of the Bot from a server.

#### 4. Third-Party Services

The Bot may rely on third-party services (such as Discord's API or payment processors) to operate. These services are governed by their own privacy policies.

The Bot does not control how Discord or other third parties handle user data.

#### 5. Data Security

Reasonable measures are taken to protect stored data. However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

#### 6. User Rights

Server owners or users may request:

- Clarification on what data is stored
- Deletion of server-specific data (where technically feasible)
- Requests can be made by contacting the Bot's support e-mail.

#### 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
